## About Me

Welcome to my site! I am a PhD Candiate in the [Natural Resource Economics and Policy Lab] (https://naturepolicy.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis where I am advised by Michael Spingborn (https://springborn.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) and James Sanchiricho (https://jamesnsanchirico.com/). My research focuses on the intersection of natural resource mangement, marine ecology, and fisheries management. I use econometric techniques in addition to models in animal movement ecology and geography to assess how commercial fisheries respond to changing ocean conditions.
